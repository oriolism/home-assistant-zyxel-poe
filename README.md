Manage the Power-over-Ethernet functionality of ZyXEL switches.
Because this functionality is not available via SNMP (WTF, ZyXEL?) it will be performed over HTTP. Admin credentials are required.

## Tested Devices

Tested with: 

- ZyXEL GS1900-8HP
- ZyXEL GS1900-10HP

Should be compatible with similar models.
